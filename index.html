    <h1>GitHub Repository - New Create Tasks</h1>
    <p>Steps on <a href="https://app.screencast.com/3XjAbfOYBbdTm">How-To "Commit"</a> to Front-End Learning</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Find new location for your next assignment (i.e. correct folder on your computer).</li>
        <li>Create new folder in VSC for that week's assignment.</li>
        <li>Create new .html and .js files</li>
        <li>Open your Terminal and find the corresponding (correct) folder to link with your new GitHub repository</li>
        <li>Create new repository (of same name as new folder in VSC) in your GitHub library</li>
        <p><b>BONUS:</b> Copy/pasta the GitHub "Create a new repository" steps to streamline creation of new folder + repository connection (and avoid typos!).</li>
        <li>Press enter (execute commands in Terminal). You should see a status-y message that shows confirmation of the new repository + folder connection being created.</p>
        <li>Use "git add ." to add the "missing" .html and .js files from your local machine's (computer) folder.</li>
        <li>Use "git status" to check that those were properly found and added for commitment (saving/uploading to GitHub repository). <b>Note:</b> Use "git status" often to check on how your new folder(s) and/or GitHub repo(s) are connecting (updating file changes).</li>
        <p>Files that have not yet been added - but were successfully found - will be shown in green text.</p>
        <li>Use "git commit -m "<i>(description)</i>" to leave a note in the GitHub repository's version history about what was added/changed/etc.</li>
    </ul>
